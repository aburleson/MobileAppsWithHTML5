Class Assignment

Had to create a webpage using HTML5 with images. I created a recipe blog page from one of my favorite cheesecake recipes.

      <h2>Looking for Something Sweet?</h2>

      <p>The honey man is not much of a sweets person, which <strong>kind</strong> of kills me! (You're killing me, smalls!)
      I am all about chocolate, peanut butter, Oreos and <em>anything</em> with the word cheesecake in it. So when I
      stumbled across this recipe from my home girl over at the-girl-who-ate-everything.com, <a href="http://www.the-girl-who-ate-everything.com">Click here</a>,
      I fell
      in love! Cinnamon rolls AND cheesecake!? Yes please!</p>

      <p>Like the recipe claims, there are a significant number of steps for making this cheesecake… but I promise you
      that it is worth it.</p>

      <h2>Instructions:</h2>

      <p>1.) Preheat oven to 350 degrees and grease a 9-inch Springform pan.</p>
      <p>2.) For the Cinnamon Roll Batter: In a large bowl or stand mixer, cream together the butter and sugar
      for a few minutes, until light and fluffy. Add the egg, milk and vanilla; beat for another minute scraping
      down the bowl. Sift together flour, baking soda and salt; combine into the creamed ingredients.
      Mix on low speed until thoroughly combined.</p>
      <p>3.) Spread half of the batter onto the bottom of the pan. You may have to spray your hands with baking
      spray to avoid dough stickiness. Layer will be thin, but will rise while in oven. Set remaining dough aside.</p>
      <p>4.) For the Cheesecake Filling: Using a stand mixer or hand mixer, beat cream cheese and sugar for 2
      minutes on medium-high speed. Add the eggs, one at a time, scraping down the bowl after each addition.
      Add the vanilla and flour and beat for another minute.</p>
      <p>5.) Pour all of the cheesecake batter on top of the cinnamon roll batter in the prepared pan.</p>
      <p>6.) Cinnamon Filling: In a small bowl, combine the melted butter, cinnamon and brown sugar; mix until
      thoroughly combined.</p> 
      <p>7.) Drop spoonfuls of the cinnamon filling over the entire top of the cheesecake, making sure not to
      get too close to the sides. Take the rest of the cinnamon roll base dough and drop spoonfuls over the
      entire top.</p>
      <p>8.) Swirl the filling and the dough using a knife… the batter will be thick but doing it slowly will
      give the best results.</p>
      <p>9.) Bake for about 45 – 55 minutes or until the center has set. Let chill for 20 minutes before moving
      to the fridge to cool (about 4 hours). Drizzle with cream cheese frosting and enjoy!</p>
